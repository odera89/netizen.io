== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I add just the button to another area of my theme? =

In the Theme Editor, you will place this line of code where you want the button to appear in your theme:`<?php if( function_exists('LIKEBOT_BUTTON') ) { LIKEBOT_BUTTON(); } ?>`

Keep in mind that manually inserted buttons wont be aligned left or right, though it will use the background-color and button-design option. Generally you should go with automagically-positioning if you're not very familiar with working with php in theme-files.

= Can i change the appearance of the LikeBot-button? =

It's possible to change the customization plugin administration. Logon as an Administrative account and click "LikeBot Plugin" in the Plugins-menu.

= Can i change the alignment of the button? =

Sure, you can change the alignment under customization in the plugin administration. 

= I've added nolikebot-tag to a post but the buttons keeps showing up? =

Be sure that you've added `<!--nolikebot-->` to the top of your post. Adding it further down could cause the LikeBot-button to appear regardless of the tag.

= The buttons doesn't show up and it says [LikeBot Error]? =
